# Anime Skip - Web Extension

Inject a custom player over the top of the certain web players (`VRV`, `Funimation`).

## Development

```bash
yarn install
yarn watch:dev
```

This will install and open firefox. To open another browser, more changes will have to be made.

## TODO

- fix hook startup assertion error/async all actions
- Progress bar is too high above the toolbar, lower it
- Add error message to preference change
- login > logout > refresh page > login > says there's an error
