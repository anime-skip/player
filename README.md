# Anime Skip - Web Extension

Inject a custom player over the top of the `VRV` and `Funimation` players.

## Development

```bash
yarn build
```

Build and install the extension in your web browser. I have tested this with Firefox, and it works well. It will open to the `example/index.html` file. This is the file used for testing, rather than the actual services to avoid over-usage of the token.
